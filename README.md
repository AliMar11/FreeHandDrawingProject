# FreeHandDrawingProject

The Free-hand drawing project is a mini drawing app completed at the Flatiron school as a demo project. The app was constructed to learn how to implement UITouch methods and Bezier curves. The ability to erase lines, change line colorm and line-width were implemented as well! 

Pictues are coming!
